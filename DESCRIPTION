Title: Hierarchical Clustering from Vertex-links
Description: Hierarchical clustering for spatial data, which requires clustering 
    results not only homogeneous in non-geographical features among samples but 
    also geographically close to each other within a cluster. It modified typically 
    used hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms for introducing the spatial 
    homogeneity, by considering geographical locations as vertices and converting 
    spatial adjacency into whether a shared edge exists between a pair of vertices. 
    The constraints of the vertex links automatically enforce the spatial contiguity 
    property at each step of iterations. In addition, methods to find an appropriate 
    number of clusters and to report cluster members are also provided.
